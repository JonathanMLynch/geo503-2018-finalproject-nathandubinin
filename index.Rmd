# Introduction to problem/question
Proxy data has been used in the creation of paleoclimate models.  These include, but are not limited to dendrochronological studies and palynological studies.  In the past decade, R has become a powerful tool with  statistical analyses, and data visualization to name just a couple ways R has been used.  Many different types of research uses R for at least some aspect of research, if it is to plot data simply using ggplot, or to create an online website using markdown or leaflet.  It has become the norm within scientiic research transcending disciplines.  This is partly because one, it is tremendously powerful as a visualization tool, and two, allows for reproducible results. Reproducibility is arguably one of the most critical aspects in scientific research.      
  
# Problem / Question
The purpose of this project is to utilize R to viusalize  ancient pollen data in southern Sweden.  It will be the groundwork for devloping a climate model specific to the Bohuslän province of Sweden.    

# Inspiring Examples

# Include links and screenshots (or embedded images) of a few (~3-5) example graphics found on the internet that convey what you want to do.  Include a few sentences about why you selected each link.

## Example 1
![](http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/forest/images/Nelson.gif)  


This is an example of a pollen diagram of Nelson Lake, Kane County, Illinois.  The y-axis represents time, encompassing 17,000 years BP (before present) and the x-axis represents the proportioin of a given species.  The graphic does not illustrate the depth of sediment, which may also be displayed on the y-axis, as will be illustrated in the following graphic.    

## Example 2

![](http://www.jefpat.org/archeobotany/Images/PollenDiagram/Image1.jpg)

This is another example of a pollen diagram representing a 4,000 year profile of the Magothy River located in Maryland.  Along the y-axis, sediment depth is represented, and it also has added radiocarbon sample dates, which are useful when looking at the overall profile to discuss when particular events happened, such as burning events.  

## Example 3
![](http://blarquez.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed-chunk-6-1-1024x731.png)

This graphic was used using ggplot2, If you would like, you could display the data as a different shape or use different colors to reprsent your graph.  Simmilar to the first graphic, the y-axis represents years BP instead of sediment depth.  

# Proposed data sources

Data will be acquired through two websites: https://www.pangaea.de/ and http://www.europeanpollendatabase.net/fpd-epd/bibli.do.  Both sites offer a plethora of pollen data, but the main focus will be identifying sites within southern Sweden.    

# Proposed methods

A couple of packages may be employed to make pollen diagrams.  The 'rioja' package allows for a simplified version of creating different types of pollen diagrams, as opposed to the use of ggplot2.  You can use ggplot2 to create pollen diagrams, as is illustrated in the "Example 3" graphic.  The 'rioja' package however makes it easier.  A series of arguements are used, with vectors representing the y and x axis, where the y-axis will represent time or sediment depth (depnding on specific data) and the x-axis representing the percentage of a given species.  There are several plot types that are built into 'rioja' so, ggplot can still be used, but is not necessry.  I will be able to download the pollen data directly from the websites mentioned in the "Proposed data sources" using the 'rioja' package.       

# Expected results

I would like to produce a series of pollen diagrams that represent a series of sites within southern Sweden, with particular attention to the province of Bohuslän.  The diagrams will be useful in discussing possible climactic trends through time given different species of vegetation.    

My really awesome and complete introduction will go here.

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).
