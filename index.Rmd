subtitle: A Brief Examination of southern Swedish Palynological Data

# Introduction  
 
Pollen diagrams offer a visualiztion of past landscapes.  They can tell a story about the past which may entail human activity or climatic events.  In the past decade, R has become a powerful tool with  statistical analyses, and data visualization in scientific research.  Due to its prevalence, R has become the norm within scientiic research transcending disciplines.  This is partly because one, it is tremendously powerful as a visualization tool, and two, allows for reproducible results.       
  
# Problem / Question
The purpose of this project is to utilize R to viusalize  ancient pollen data in southern Sweden.  By visualizing pollen data, we can start to ask questions.  Two questions will be asked for this project. What narratives can be told examining pollen diagrams?  Does the story glean any information pertaining to climatic events or cultural transformation of landscape?   

# Inspiring Examples



## Example 1
![](http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/forest/images/Nelson.gif)  


This is an example of a pollen diagram of Nelson Lake, Kane County, Illinois.  The y-axis represents time, encompassing 17,000 years BP (before present) and the x-axis represents the proportioin of a given species.  The graphic does not illustrate the depth of sediment, which may also be displayed on the y-axis, as will be illustrated in the following graphic.    

## Example 2

![](http://www.jefpat.org/archeobotany/Images/PollenDiagram/Image1.jpg)

This is another example of a pollen diagram representing a 4,000 year profile of the Magothy River located in Maryland.  Along the y-axis, sediment depth is represented, and it also has added radiocarbon sample dates, which are useful when looking at the overall profile to discuss when particular events happened, such as burning events.  

## Example 3
![](http://blarquez.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed-chunk-6-1-1024x731.png)

This graphic was used using ggplot2, If you would like, you could display the data as a different shape or use different colors to reprsent your graph.  Simmilar to the first graphic, the y-axis represents years BP instead of sediment depth.  

# Data sources

Data accessed from the European Pollen Database (EPD) via the Neotoma Paleoecology Database Explorer.

DISCLAIMER: It should be noted that according to the EPD, Neotoma is not completely up to date.

# Proposed Methods

A series of packages are employed to make pollen diagrams.  These consist of the 'rioja'  and 'analogue' packages allowing for a simplified version of creating of a pollen diagrams, as opposed to the use of ggplot2.  You can use ggplot2 to create pollen diagrams, as is illustrated in the "Example 3" graphic.  The 'rioja' package however makes it easier.  A series of arguements are used, with vectors representing the y and x axis, where the y-axis will represent time or sediment depth (depnding on specific data) and the x-axis representing the percentage of a given species.  There are several plot types that are built into 'rioja' so, ggplot can still be used, but is not necessry.  I will be able to download the pollen data directly from the websites mentioned in the "Proposed data sources" using the 'rioja' package.       

# Expected results

I would like to produce a series of pollen diagrams that represent a series of sites within southern Sweden, with particular attention to the province of BohuslÃ¤n.  The diagrams will be useful in discussing possible climactic trends through time given different species of vegetation.    

My really awesome and complete introduction will go here.

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.



# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
